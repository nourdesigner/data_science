#### Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations

##### Predicting Blood Donations
We've all got to start somewhere. 
This is the smallest, least complex dataset on DrivenData. 
That makes it a great place to dive into the world of data science competitions. 
Get your blood pumping and try your hand at predicting donations.

##### Blood Donations
Blood donation has been around for a long time.
The first successful recorded transfusion was between two dogs in 1665, and the first medical use of human blood in a transfusion occurred in 1818. 
Even today, donated blood remains a critical resource during emergencies.

##### Red Cross, 1943

Our dataset is from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan. 
The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. 
We want to predict whether or not a donor will give blood the next time the vehicle comes to campus.
