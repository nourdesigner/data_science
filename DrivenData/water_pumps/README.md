#### DrivenData - Pump It Up: Data Mining The Water Table (In Progress)

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, I predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. This is an intermediate-level practice competition on DrivenData. I predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed using Random Forest.
